Understand Natural Languge and Trigger Business Worflows with |LEX|

What is LEX?
==============

LEX is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice and text. With LEX, the same deep learning engine that powers Amazon Alexa is now available to any developer, enabling you to build sophisticated, natural language chatbots into your new and existing applications. LEX provides the deep functionality and flexibility of natural language understanding (NLU) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) to enable you to build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike, conversational interactions and create new categories of products.

LEX enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With LEX, no deep learning expertise is necessaryâ€”you just specify the basic conversation flow in the LEX console to create a bot. LEX manages the dialogue and dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation. Using the console, you can build, test, and publish your text or voice chatbot. You can then add the conversational interfaces to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger).

LEX provides pre-built integration with AWS Lambda, and you can easily integrate with many other services on the AWS platform including Amazon Cognito, AWS Mobile Hub, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon DynamoDB. Integration with AWS Lambda provides bots access to pre-built serverless enterprise connectors, to link to data in SaaS applications, such as Salesforce, HubSpot or Marketo.

Using the following resources, you can integrate LEX withyour Android app to add a flexible natural language interface without deep knowledge of either AWS services or natural language computing.
